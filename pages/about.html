<h1>Jason's Wildthings Refuge</h1>

<blockquote>
A pragmatic paleontologist touring an almost complete 
theme park on an island in Central America is tasked 
with protecting a couple of kids after a power failure 
causes the park's cloned dinosaurs to run loose. Huge 
advancements in scientific technology have enabled a 
mogul to create an island full of living dinosaurs.
